Description: 
MP-IDB comprises four species of Malaria parasites: Falciparum, Malariae, Ovale, Vivax. 
For each species, there are four distinct stages of life, described in the filenames as follows:
- R: indicates the presence of 1 or more Ring stage parasites
- T: indicates the presence of 1 or more Trophozoite stage parasites
- S: indicates the presence of 1 or more Schizont stage parasites
- G: indicates the presence of 1 or more Gametocyte stage parasites.

Each original image has its own ground-truth, provided by expert pathologists, while every image has been analyzed from left to right, therefore every filename indicates the presence of the parasites following this indication.
